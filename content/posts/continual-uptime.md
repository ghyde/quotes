When disaster finally did strike, it didnâ€™t come in the form of fraudulent
transaction. The donut box fell over, late on Friday night. Roland had to call
Roy, who had to commute into the office to stand the box back up. After doing
some root cause analysis, Roy also taped the box to a server rack, thus
guaranteeing continual uptime.
