According to Science Fiction writer Robert Heinlein, "all military bureaucracies consist of a Surprise Party Department, a Practical Joke Department, and a Fairy Godmother Department. The first two process most matters, as the third is very small...[consisting] of one elderly G5 female clerk, usually out on sick leave." So of course your orders were processed by the Practical Joke and/or Surprise Party Depts.
