1. No prototypes. Just make the game. Polish as you go. Don't depend on polish
   happening later. Always maintain constantly shippable code.
2. It's incredibly important that your game can always be run by your team.
   Bulletproof your engine by providing defaults upon load failure.
3. Keep your code absolutely simple. Keep looking at your functions and figure
   out how you can simplify further.
4. Great tools help make great games. Spend as much time on tools as possible.
5. We are our own best testing team and should never allow anyone else to
   experience bugs or see the game crash. Don't waste others' time. Test
   thoroughly before checking in your code.
6. As soon as you see a bug, you fix it. Do not continue on. If you don't fix
   your bugs your new code will be built on a buggy codebase and ensure an
   unstable foundation.
7. Use a development system that is superior to your target.
8. Write your code for this game only - not for a future game. You're going to
   be writing new code later because you'll be smarter.
9. Encapsulate functionality to ensure design consistency. This minimizes
   mistakes and saves design time.
10. Try to code transparently. Tell your lead and peers exactly how you are
   going to solve your current task and get feedback and advice. Do not treat
   game programming like each coder is a black box. The project could go off the
   rails and cause delays.
