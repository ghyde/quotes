**Casey:** What is going on here?

**Big Mike:** Store's being bought. They're canning everybody except Bartowski
and Grimes.

**Jeff:** We're staging a revolution to take down the man.

**Casey:** I want in.

**Lester:** How do we know that we can trust you, son? That you're not some kind
of spy for the man?

**Casey:** Because the only thing I hate more than hippie neo-liberal fascists
and anarchistsâ€¦ are the hypocrite fat-cat suits they eventually grow up to become.

**Lester:** Yep, that works for me. Good-good-good point. Nice to chat.

**Big Mike:** Welcome aboard, my brother.
