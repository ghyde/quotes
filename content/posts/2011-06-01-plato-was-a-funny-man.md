Plato was a funny little Greek man who lived a long time ago. He is
probably best known for two things: First, for writing stories about his
friends, and second for philosophically proving that somewhere in the
eternities there exists a perfect slice of cheesecake. (Read the
Parmenides -- it's in there.)
