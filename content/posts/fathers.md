First of all, fathers are giving a name and a heritage to their children &mdash; clean and honorable. Fathers are for long, hard work, mostly their own kind of work; â€¦ for trying to give their children things [their] fathers never had. Fathers are for talking with, for encouraging, for putting arms around; for understanding mistakes, but not condoning them; for disciplining when needed, then loving all the more; for being strong and forceful, and for being tender and gentle.

-- Elder Richard L. Evans ("The Father Who Cares" by President James E. Faust, Ensign, September 2009)
