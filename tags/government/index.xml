      <description>According to Science Fiction writer Robert Heinlein, &amp;ldquo;all military bureaucracies consist of a Surprise Party Department, a Practical Joke Department, and a Fairy Godmother Department. The first two process most matters, as the third is very small&amp;hellip;[consisting] of one elderly G5 female clerk, usually out on sick leave.&amp;rdquo; So of course your orders were processed by the Practical Joke and/or Surprise Party Depts.

      <description>In politics, the only way to know who&amp;rsquo;s stabbing you in the back is to see their reflection in the eyes of the person stabbing you from the back.
