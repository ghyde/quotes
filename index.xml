But I am prouder — infinitely prouder — to be a father. A soldier destroys in order to build; the father only builds, never destroys. The one has the potentiality of death; the other embodies creation and life. And while the hordes of death are mighty, the battalions of life are mightier still. It is my hope that my son, when I am gone, will remember me not from the battle but in the home repeating with him our simple daily prayer, &amp;ldquo;Our Father who art in heaven.</description></item><item><title>A Statesman</title><link>/posts/statesman/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/statesman/</guid><description>A statesman is a politician who&amp;rsquo;s been dead 10 or 15 years.

Keep looking at your functions and figure out how you can simplify further. Great tools help make great games.
